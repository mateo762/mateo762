- 👋 Hi, I’m @mateo762, Mateo Echeverry Hoyos
- 📚 I'm a student currently enrolled in the Master's degree program in Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven. I previously completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, which included an exchange year at EPFL, where I took courses in the Master's in Data Science program. I'm a curious and analytical person, with a strong interest in AI and the challenges it presents.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and Data Analysis, and the ways in which these fields can be applied to solve real-world problems. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of technology and social issues, and how data can be used to create positive change.
- 📊 I’m currently learning about Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, and how these technologies can be used to build intelligent systems. I’m also interested in learning more about Web Development and full-stack engineering.
- 🖊️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve Data Science, Machine Learning, or Web Development. I’m always open to new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I believe that working on collaborative projects is a great way to do so.
- 📫 If you’d like to get in touch, you can reach me at mateo.echeverryhoyos@gmail.com or through my website at https://mateo762.github.io/. I’m also active on LinkedIn and GitHub, where you can find more information about my projects and experience.
