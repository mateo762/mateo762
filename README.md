- 👋 Hi, I’m @mateo762, Mateo Echeverry Hoyos
- 📚 I’m a Computer Engineer student currently enrolled as an exchange student at EPFL, where I’m finishing my bachelor’s with courses in the Maste's in Data Science. I’m a curious and analytical person, with a strong interest in Data Science and the challenges it presents.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and Data Analysis, and the ways in which these fields can be applied to solve real-world problems. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of technology and social issues, and how data can be used to create positive change.
- 📊 I’m currently learning about Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, and how these technologies can be used to build intelligent systems. I’m also interested in learning more about Web Development and full-stack engineering.
- 🖊️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve Data Science, Machine Learning, or Web Development. I’m always open to new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I believe that working on collaborative projects is a great way to do so.
- 📫 If you’d like to get in touch, you can reach me at mateo.echeverryhoyos@gmail.com or through my website at https://mateo762.github.io/. I’m also active on LinkedIn and GitHub, where you can find more information about my projects and experience.
